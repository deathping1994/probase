py-bcrypt is an implementation the OpenBSD Blowfish password hashing
algorithm, as described in "A Future-Adaptable Password Scheme" by
Niels Provos and David Mazieres.

This system hashes passwords using a version of Bruce Schneier's
Blowfish block cipher with modifications designed to raise the cost
of off-line password cracking. The computation cost of the algorithm
is parametised, so it can be increased as computers get faster.
